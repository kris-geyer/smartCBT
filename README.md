# smartCBT

## rationale 

this is a personal project that investigates if CBT therapy can be enhanced through utilising retrospective smartphone tracking capabilities. In other words, the app operates as a diary but entries are generally intended to be about when people have thoughts and emotions that are negative and are likely unfounded. But, this diary has a twist, when people document when they had negative feelings then the app brings up records of what their phone was being used for at that time. Then the user is asked if these events were significant in why they feel so negative if they are the record is added. Eventually, the app will develop detailed records of the smartphone-based activities that trigger their negative emotions. I hope this may make it easier to identify when they are being bullied online or assist them to identify what digital behaviour is hurting their mental health.
